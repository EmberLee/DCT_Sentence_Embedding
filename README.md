# Efficient Sentence Embedding using Discrete Cosine Transform

## Dependencies

- Download SentEval from [this link ](https://github.com/facebookresearch/SentEval) and follow their instructions to download datasets and Dependencies.

- Add DCT.py to examples directory.



## How to use this code

1- To reproduce the results for DCT, run (in examples/):
```
python DCT.py 'k'
```
where k is the number of cofficents to keep.

2- For parameeters tuning please follow the instructions from SentEval. 



## An illustration of DCT embeddings 


![alt text](https://github.com/N-Almarwani/DCT_Sentence_Embedding/blob/master/DCT_Example.png)
Figure 1: An illustration of DCT embeddings. The size of the sentence to encode is 4 Ã— 5, where 4 is the number of words and 5 is the number of word embedding dimensions. Each feature vector is transformed using DCT independently. In this example, the final representation is the concatenation of the first two coefficient from all transformed features.
